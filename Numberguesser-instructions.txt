Number Guessing Game Instruction for developing game:

Create a generateTarget() function. 
This function will be called at the start of each new round in order to generate the new secret target number.
This function should return a integer between 0 and 9


Create a compareGuesses() function. This function will be called each round to determine which guess is closest to the target number.

This function:Has three parameters representing the user (human) guess, a computer guess, and the secret target number to be guessed.
Determines which player (human or computer) wins based on which guess is closest to the target. If both players are tied, the human user should win.
Return true if the human player wins, and false if the computer player wins.

Add functionality to check whether the user guess is between 0 and 9 and alert() the user that their number is out of range. 
It’s not possible to set a number outside this range with the + and = buttons, but users can do so by typing directly in the input field.

Create an updateScore() function. This function will be used to correctly increase the winner’s score after each round.

This function:
Has a single parameter. This parameter will be a string value representing the winner.
Increases the score variable (humanScore or computerScore) by 1 depending on the winner passed in to updateScore. The string passed in will be either 'human' or 'computer'.
Does not need to return any value. 

Create an advanceRound() function. This function will be used to update the round number after each round
advanceRound() should increase the value of currentRoundNumber by 1.
After completing advanceRound(), your Number Guesser game should be fully operational. 
You should be able to make guesses, see your or the computer score increase correctly, move to the next round, and see the correct round displayed.
